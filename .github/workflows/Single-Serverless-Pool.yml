# Sample of how to deploy to an Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pool using GitHub Actions
# You can use a self-hosted runner installed locally for this to work
# You can also use a GitHub-hosted runner

# For this pipeline you also need to setup the below encrypted secrets (https://bit.ly/3nd0Jj8)
  # sqlinstance - Your Serverless SQL Pool endpoint 
    #(the one that ends with -ondemand)
  # database - The database in the SQL Pool you want the update deployed to
    # Note it has to exist BEFORE this the scripts are run
  # UserName - User name to connect to the Serverless SQL Pool endpoint
    # try and keep this secret
  # Pw - Password of above user, definitely keep this one secret

#Sets the trigger to update when update is pushed to main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
